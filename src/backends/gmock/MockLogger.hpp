/**
 * @brief Mock implementation of logger for testing purposes
 *
 * @details This class provides a mock implementation of the logger interface
 * using Google Mock. It can be used to verify that logging calls are made with
 * the expected parameters and at the expected severity levels during tests.
 *
 * The mock implements the LoggerBackend concept and provides methods to set
 * expectations on logging calls and verify that they were satisfied. It's
 * designed to work with the LogStream class for stream-based logging in tests.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * MockLogger<MockConfig> mock_logger(config);
 *
 * // Test message logging at different severity levels
 * EXPECT_CALL(mock_logger, LogMessage(LogLevel::Info, "Starting test"));
 * EXPECT_CALL(mock_logger, LogMessage(LogLevel::Error, "Test failed"));
 *
 * // When using stream API, the eventual message string is what gets logged
 * // So you set expectations on the LogMessage method with the final string
 * EXPECT_CALL(mock_logger, LogMessage(LogLevel::Info, "User 123 logged in from
 * 192.168.1.1"));
 *
 * // Then pass the mock to code under test
 * TestFunction(mock_logger);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @tparam ConfigBackend The configuration backend type required by the logger
