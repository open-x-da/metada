/**
 * @brief Stream-like class for logging that supports the << operator
 *
 * This class provides a stream interface similar to std::cout for logging
 * messages. It allows chaining of << operators to build log messages from
 * different types of data.
 *
 * The LogStream captures all data inserted via the << operator in an internal
 * string stream and forwards the complete message to the appropriate logger
 * method when the stream is destroyed or explicitly flushed.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * logger.Info() << "User " << user_id << " logged in from " << ip_address;
 * logger.Error() << "Failed to process request: " << error_code << " - " <<
 * error_message;
 * @endcode
 *
 * @tparam Backend The logger backend type that implements the LoggerBackend
 * concept
 * @tparam ConfigBackend The configuration backend type required by the logger
