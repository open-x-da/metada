Core Design Principles
======================

Modularity
----------
METADA is built on the principle of modular design, allowing components to be developed, tested, and maintained independently. This approach enables:

- Easy integration of new data assimilation methods
- Flexible observation operator implementations
- Pluggable numerical models
- Customizable error covariance representations

Performance-Oriented
--------------------
The system is designed with high-performance computing in mind:

- GPU acceleration for compute-intensive operations
- Efficient memory management for large-scale problems
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Optimized linear algebra operations

Extensibility
-------------
The architecture promotes extensibility through:

- Clear interface definitions
- Plugin system for custom implementations
- Language interoperability (C++, Python, Fortran)
- Standardized data structures

Scientific Reproducibility
--------------------------
Emphasis on reproducible scientific results through:

- Version control of experiments
- Detailed logging and diagnostics
- Automated testing framework
- Documentation of numerical methods
