1. **A Localized Particle Filter for High-Dimensional Nonlinear Systems**
   
   - Author: Jonathan Poterjoy
   - Journal: Monthly Weather Review (2016)
   - DOI: `10.1175/MWR-D-15-0163.1 <https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/144/1/mwr-d-15-0163.1.xml>`_
   - Description: Presents a novel particle filtering approach that maintains 
     non-Gaussian features while scaling efficiently to high-dimensional systems 
     through localization
